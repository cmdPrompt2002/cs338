===== DAYTIME =====
1: Parts that are relevant to the TCP handshake

Client sends sequence number to server
1	0.000000000	192.168.64.2	129.6.15.28	TCP	74	41792 → 13 [SYN] Seq=0 Win=32120 Len=0 MSS=1460 SACK_PERM TSval=1207810283 TSecr=0 WS=128
Server sends an acknowledgement number to client, and also a different sequence number
2	0.166142748	129.6.15.28	192.168.64.2	TCP	66	13 → 41792 [SYN, ACK] Seq=0 Ack=1 Win=65535 Len=0 MSS=1382 WS=64 SACK_PERM
Client sends an acknowledgement number to server
3	0.166254212	192.168.64.2	129.6.15.28	TCP	54	41792 → 13 [ACK] Seq=1 Ack=1 Win=32128 Len=0

2: 41792
3: The communication is between one software from the client machine,
so a port number is essential for distinguishing which software in the client machine the server should communicate to.

5: If some data goes missing or gets corrupted along the way, 
there needs to be a way for the sender to know how much the target has received.
Thus where the sequence number comes into play - 
the client sends a [SYN] packet which contains the sequence number, 
and the server responds with a [SYN, ACK] packet, which contains (1) an acknowledgement number which
tells ths client that it has received the [SYN] packet, and (2) a different sequence number
that allows the client to acknowledge this packet.

In short:
[ACK] is an acknowledgement that information has been received.
[SYN] is a sequence number that allows the sender to know, by virtue of receiving, or not receiving, an [ACK] later on,
whether the packet is delivered correctly to the target.

6: The daytime server initiated the closing first because it's the first server to send a packet with a [FIN] label,
which suggests that it's for closing the connection.

===== HTTP =====
1: There are two TCP connections since there are two packets that are labeled as both [SYN] and [ACK]
