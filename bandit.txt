    Important lessons: the dashed character is important and mean different things in different context.
    It can be used as a file name, or a special character that indicates options for a program, or for getting stuff to and from the stdout and stdin.

    Solution
        cat “spaces in this filename”
    Important lessons: spaces are usually interpreted as an argument separator.

    uniq -u only prints out the lines with no adjacent duplicate.

    and STRING2, which indicates what the characters in STRING1 should be translated to.
